# tinyengine

### What is tiny engine?
Tiny engine is a lightweight modular game engine that allows nearly everything as a plugin. The vision of the project is to create a bare bones engine with only the minimum of what is required. From there, developers can figure out what features they want and add the corresponding plugin. For example, if a user wants to have native rendering support for Mac they can install the plugin. Another example, a user wants to use support for importing stp files? Add the corresponding plugin. 

#### Side Objective #1
 Tiny should be able to be a drop in framework for existing projects. Have a software renderer that you want to make into a game engine? Drop in tiny and make the proper connections and boom game engine.

#### Side Objective #2
Tiny will have it's own editor following the same principles. But will also maintain compatibility with external tools.

#### Side Objective #3
Further down the line(maybe) tiny will have extra game related plugins for different types of resource management.

### Why even make tiny?
While it would be awesome to have many people use tiny. The goal overall is to make myself a better developer and hopefully help people along the way!
